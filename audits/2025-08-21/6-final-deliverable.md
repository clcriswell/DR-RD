# Area 6: Final Deliverable

## Summary
No comprehensive build guide, appendices, or reproducibility tooling were found.

## Checklist
- [ ] 6.1 Exhaustive Build Guide with setup, run, deploy, and rollback instructions (FAIL)
- [ ] 6.2 Appendices covering prompt cards, role cards, run logs, datasets, and evals (FAIL)
- [ ] 6.3 Reproducibility via one script or Make target to regenerate the final artifact (FAIL)

## Evidence
- No `docs/build_guide.md` present
- No `docs/appendices/` directory with run logs, datasets, or evals
- `Makefile` lacks a reproducibility target

## Gaps
- Missing build guide with setup, run, deploy, and rollback details
- Missing appendices with prompt cards, role cards, run logs, datasets, and evaluations
- Missing script or Makefile target for reproducible final artifacts

## Minimal Fix Suggestions
- Add `docs/build_guide.md` documenting setup, run, deploy, and rollback steps
- Create `docs/appendices/` with prompt cards, role cards, run logs, datasets, and evals
- Add a script or Make target that regenerates the final deliverable
