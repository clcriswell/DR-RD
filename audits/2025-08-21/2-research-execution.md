# Area 2: Research Execution

## Summary
Verified multi-agent loop, API adapter with budget tracking, dossier aggregation, gap checks, and dry-run configuration.

## Checklist
- PASS 2.1 Agent loop controller present with pluggable role prompts
- PASS 2.2 External APIs abstracted behind adapters with time and token budgets
- PASS 2.3 Dossier builder aggregates findings with source attribution
- PASS 2.4 Lead agent gap check implemented with retry or follow-up tasks
- PASS 2.5 Runbook or config to enable dry-run with fixtures

## Evidence
- `core/orchestrator.py` `run_pipeline` loops over tasks and uses `revise_plan` for follow-ups
- `core/llm_client.py` exposes `TokenMeter` and `BudgetManager` for budget tracking
- `core/dossier.py` provides `Dossier.record_finding` capturing `Finding` objects
- `config/dry_run.yaml` defines dry-run mode and fixtures directory

## Gaps
- None identified

## Minimal Fix Suggestions
- None
