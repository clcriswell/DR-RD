# Final Report

## Executive Summary
A dry-run R&D audit validated the pipeline for orchestrating multi-agent tasks and produced a lightweight prototype plan for the project idea.

## Problem & Value
The project demonstrates a structured process for exploring new concepts, consolidating research, and planning implementationâ€”providing stakeholders with a repeatable pathway from idea to prototype.

## Research Findings
- Intake and scoping captured baseline questions and confirmed configuration readiness.
- Research tasks executed in a mock loop, yielding logs and preliminary insights.
- Proof-of-concept tests generated sample artifacts to exercise the workflow.

## Risks & Unknowns
- Real data integrations remain untested.
- A reproducibility script is still required for full release.

## Architecture & Interfaces
The prototype ties together a planner, executor, and synthesizer orchestrator. Interfaces between agents and artifact writers were validated in test mode, outlining a path toward an executable build guide.

## Regulatory & Compliance
No compliance issues surfaced during the dry run, but regulatory requirements should be reassessed when live data is introduced.

## IP & Prior Art
The mock evaluation found no blocking prior-art concerns; formal searches are recommended before production.

## Market & GTM
Market analysis was not included in this dry run and should be incorporated in future iterations to assess competitive and go-to-market factors.

## Cost Overview
Cost estimations were not generated; budgeting exercises remain a future task.

## Next Steps
- Replace mock inputs with real integrations and data.
- Add the missing reproducibility script.
- Expand marketing and cost analyses for production readiness.
