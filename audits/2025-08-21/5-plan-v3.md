# Area 5: Plan v3 (Build Spec & Work Plan)

## Summary
The repository lacks comprehensive build specifications and work planning artifacts. A minimal architecture note exists but omits key sections required for a full system design.

## Checklist
- [ ] 5.1 System Design Doc includes components, interfaces, data flow, and risks (FAIL)
- [ ] 5.2 Build Spec with API contracts, schemas, and acceptance criteria (FAIL)
- [ ] 5.3 Work plan with milestones, owners, estimates, and decision log (FAIL)

## Evidence
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` lacks required sections
- No `docs/build_spec.md` present
- No `docs/work_plan.yaml` present

## Gaps
- Missing detailed system design covering interfaces, data flow, and risks
- No build spec outlining API contracts, schemas, or acceptance criteria
- No project work plan with milestones and decision log

## Minimal Fix Suggestions
- Expand `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` to document components, interfaces, data flow, and risks
- Add `docs/build_spec.md` describing API contracts, schemas, and acceptance criteria
- Add `docs/work_plan.yaml` with milestones, owners, estimates, and decision log
