# Area 1: Plan v1 (Concept & Research Plan)

## Summary
Planning artifacts capture concept briefs, role definitions, structured task segmentation, and explicit redaction guidance.

## Checklist
- [x] 1.1 Concept brief template exists — PASS
- [x] 1.2 Role cards for Planner/PM and other agents — PASS
- [x] 1.3 Task segmentation plan (role→tasks→inputs→outputs) — PASS
- [x] 1.4 Redaction policy bound into planning prompts — PASS

## Evidence
- 1.1 `docs/concept_brief.md` template with sections for problem, users, assumptions, risks, metrics, guardrails, and redaction policy【F:docs/concept_brief.md†L1-L13】
- 1.2 `docs/roles/role_planner.md` outlines guardrails including redaction【F:docs/roles/role_planner.md†L1-L12】
- 1.3 `planning/task_plan.yaml` defines roles, tasks, inputs, outputs, and redaction policy path【F:planning/task_plan.yaml†L1-L12】
- 1.4 `prompts/planning/planner_prompt.md` instructs applying the redaction policy before emitting outputs【F:prompts/planning/planner_prompt.md†L1-L1】

## Gaps
- None identified.

## Minimal Fix Suggestions
- Maintain up-to-date planning templates and role cards as scope evolves.
