# Area 4: PoC Execution (digital twin / simulation)

## Summary
- Simulation manager provides a harness for running structural, thermal, electronics, and chemical simulations.
- QA routing hook allows failed simulations to be escalated for review.
- No runs/ or outputs/ directory found for timestamped artifact persistence.

## Checklist
- [PASS] 4.1 Simulation harness or digital twin entrypoint exists with seed data.
- [PASS] 4.2 Results routed to QA or back to research on FAIL.
- [FAIL] 4.3 Artifacts persisted under a runs/ or outputs/ folder with timestamps.

## Evidence
- `simulation/simulation_manager.py`
- *(no runs/ or outputs/ directory with timestamped artifacts found)*

## Gaps
- Simulation results are not persisted under timestamped runs/outputs folders.

## Minimal fix suggestions
- Write simulation outputs to `runs/<timestamp>/` or `outputs/<timestamp>/` to preserve artifacts.
