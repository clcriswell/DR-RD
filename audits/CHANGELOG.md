## 2025-09-16 – Baseline Entry: Automated Compartmentalization

**Score:** 6.5 / 10 (initial baseline)

**Summary of Current State:**
- Planner outputs all tasks with full idea context. No schema support yet for inputs/outputs/constraints.  
- Agent prompts include full project idea, not isolated module context.  
- No evaluator hook exists for scope leakage.  
- Synthesizer compiles outputs but does not flag contradictions or interface mismatches.  
- Tests for compartmentalization do not yet exist.

**Next Steps (as tasks in codex_plan.yaml):**
- Extend Planner schema and prompt templates to support description, role, inputs, outputs, constraints.  
- Remove “Idea” lines from all agent prompts and pass only module-specific context.  
- Implement `compartment_check` evaluator hook and integrate it into evaluation_hooks.  
- Add Synthesizer logic for contradiction detection and confidence adjustment.  
- Create unit tests in `tests/eval/test_compartmentalization.py` to validate Planner schema, agent prompt isolation, scope validation, and Synthesizer contradictions.

**Notes:**
This baseline captures the system before implementing the Automated Compartmentalization plan. All subsequent entries should track improvements in isolation, validation, and integration behavior.
