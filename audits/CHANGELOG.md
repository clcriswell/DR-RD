2025-09-19 – Final Compartmentalization Audit
Score: 10 / 10 (compartmentalization fully implemented)
Summary of Current State:
- Complete module isolation. All planned compartmentalization features have been delivered. The Planner
outputs tasks with all required fields (no schema errors), and every agent’s prompt now contains only taskspecific context (no “Idea” or overall project info). The Reflection agent also operates without the global
idea, using only the collated agent outputs to propose follow-ups.
- Automated scope enforcement. A compartment_check evaluator runs after each task, confirming that
agents do not stray out of scope. In this audit run, no scope violations were detected (agents never
mentioned the hidden project or other roles). The Synthesizer integrates all agent outputs and reports any
cross-task inconsistencies in a contradictions field (none were found, indicating a consistent final
plan).
- End-to-end success. The compartmentalized pipeline executed successfully from start to finish. Unlike the
9/17 run (which halted due to a Planner JSON issue), this run produced a complete final report on the first
attempt. All sub-tasks were completed with neutral wording and merged into a cohesive output for the user.
Compartmentalization did not impede the solution; rather, it added a privacy layer while still addressing the
full project scope via the Synthesizer.
Next Steps (as tasks in codex_plan.yaml):
- Remove or merge any redundant agent classes (e.g. FinanceSpecialistAgent) to streamline the agent
registry and avoid role overlap confusion. Ensure tests cover instantiation of all agents in the registry.
- Expand integration tests to cover a scenario with a required ReflectionAgent loop, verifying the system can
handle follow-up planning in compartmentalized mode without leaking information.
Notes: This audit confirms that DR-RD’s automated compartmentalization is working as designed, elevating
the score from the prior audit’s 9/10 to a perfect 10. The system mirrors real-world “need-to-know”
collaboration, with each agent focusing only on its piece of the puzzle and the core orchestrator handling integration. Future enhancements will concentrate on optional mode toggling and minor refactoring/testing, as the primary goals for secure, modular AI-driven R&D have been achieved.
