**DR-RD Audit Change Log** (tracking score changes and improvements) 

### 2025-09-11 Update

* **Scores:** Pipeline 9→9, Architecture 8→8, Prompt 9→9, Artifacts 9→10, Privacy 10→10.
  *Overall:* The repository’s overall audit score improved slightly, with one category (Artifacts) rising to a perfect 10 thanks to recent enhancements. Other category scores remain unchanged from the 2025-09-10 audit, but with notable incremental improvements as described below.

* **Recent Merged PRs (Last 5):**
  • **[#471](#)** – *CI Workflow Unification:* Merged separate test/lint and supply-chain workflows, ensuring all checks run in a single pipeline (no product code changes).
  • **[#470](#)** – *Planning: Add Task Group IDs:* The Planner now assigns a `group` to each task (e.g. grouping related tasks under a theme). This metadata addition improves organizational clarity for complex plans, though it’s not yet surfaced in outputs. No effect on current functionality, but lays groundwork for future UI grouping.
  • **[#469](#)** – *Bootstrap CI Enhancements:* Introduced stricter CI enforcement (running unit tests, type checks, linting, and secret scanning on every commit). This improves code quality and security compliance per internal guidelines, without altering runtime behavior.
  • **[#468](#)** – *Fix (Reliability): Placeholder Handling & QA Fallback:* Improved the pipeline’s fault tolerance. When an agent fails to provide substantive output after retries, the system now logs a clear warning and marks the result as a placeholder. Additionally, if the **QA** agent’s first pass returns all placeholder content (i.e. no real findings), the orchestrator will auto-reinvoke the QA agent with a higher model or adjusted prompt. These changes ensure that *every* stage produces at least some non-placeholder result or explicitly flags an open issue, aligning with Playbook reliability guidance. New tests cover these scenarios, and no “TODO” or blank sections should appear in final reports now.
  • **[#467](#)** – *Feat (Prompts/Schemas): Schema Standardization:* Refined several agent prompt templates and schemas. Notably, all agents now use **arrays** for the **`risks`** and **`next_steps`** fields (no agent will output a single string for these), which fixes slight inconsistencies and makes parsing easier. The **MaterialsEngineerAgent** prompt was strengthened with stricter requirements (must provide real material properties/trade-offs and credible sources; no placeholder names). These prompt tweaks improve alignment with the contract (every required JSON key present with correct types, no extraneous formatting).

* **Next Steps:** Based on the audit findings and Playbook recommendations, we propose the following tasks to further improve compliance and quality (each mapped to relevant modules/tests):

  * **TSK-001: Integrate SynthesizerAgent in Final Stage** – Use the `SynthesizerAgent` to generate the final combined report in JSON (per **synthesizer_v1.json** schema) instead of the current direct LLM approach. This will enforce a schema-validated final output and fully conform to the Playbook’s *“standardized pipeline”*.
    *Targets:* `core/orchestrator.py`, `dr_rd/agents/synthesizer_agent.py`.
    *Test:* Ensure that a full run produces a final JSON that includes expected sections before rendering to markdown.

  * **TSK-002: Handle Planner Output Fields** – Ensure that Planner-generated fields like **constraints**, **assumptions**, and **risk_register** are either propagated to outputs or removed if unused. This prevents loss of important context. For example, map Planner’s `risk_register` into the agents’ or final report’s risks section if policy-aware planning is on.
    *Targets:* `dr_rd/schemas/planner_v1.json`, `dr_rd/agents/planner_agent.py`.
    *Test:* Extend planning tests to include non-empty constraints/assumptions and verify they appear in the final JSON or are intentionally omitted with no dangling data.

  * **TSK-003: Agent Roles Audit (Dead Code Removal)** – Review the agent registry for any roles that are never invoked and remove or consolidate them. For instance, if **FinanceSpecialistAgent** duplicates **FinanceAgent** functionality, retire one and update any references accordingly. Also ensure every defined agent can be routed to: update router keywords/synonyms for any missing mappings.
    *Targets:* `core/agents/finance_specialist_agent.py`, `core/router.py`, `core/agents/unified_registry.py`.
    *Test:* Create a parametric test that tries to route a dummy task for each role in `AGENT_REGISTRY` and asserts an agent is returned (no dead-ends).

  * **TSK-004: Complete Mode Flag Cleanup** – Fully remove deprecated mode flags and config toggles related to old “test”/“deep” modes. The addendum calls for a single unified mode, so any residual code or docs referencing multiple modes should be excised. For example, eliminate `DISABLE_IMAGES_BY_DEFAULT` and any logic branching on a mode name.
    *Targets:* `config/feature_flags.py`, `app/`, and `docs/`.
    *Test:* Static analysis (grep or a lightweight script) to confirm no occurrence of legacy mode names or flags in the codebase (except perhaps in migration notes).
