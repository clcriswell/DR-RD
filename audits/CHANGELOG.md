DR-RD Audit Changelog
2025-09-16 – Baseline Entry: Automated Compartmentalization
Score: 6.5 / 10 (initial baseline)
Summary of Current State: - Planner outputs all tasks with full idea context. No schema support yet for inputs/outputs/constraints.
- Agent prompts include full project idea, not isolated module context.
- No evaluator hook exists for scope leakage.
- Synthesizer compiles outputs but does not flag contradictions or interface mismatches.
- Tests for compartmentalization do not yet exist.
Next Steps (as tasks in codex_plan.yaml): - Extend Planner schema and prompt templates to support description, role, inputs, outputs, constraints.
- Remove “Idea” lines from all agent prompts and pass only module-specific context.
- Implement compartment_check evaluator hook and integrate it into evaluation_hooks.
- Add Synthesizer logic for contradiction detection and confidence adjustment.
- Create unit tests in tests/eval/test_compartmentalization.py to validate Planner schema, agent prompt isolation, scope validation, and Synthesizer contradictions.
Notes: This baseline captures the system before implementing the Automated Compartmentalization plan. All subsequent entries should track improvements in isolation, validation, and integration behavior.
2025-09-17 – Post-Compartmentalization Audit
Score: 8 / 10 (compartmentalization improvements)
Summary of Current State: - Planner now outputs tasks with structured fields (id, title, summary, description, role, inputs, outputs, constraints) per module. However, the Planner’s JSON output in testing missed some required top-level fields (like plan metadata), causing a schema validation failure and run abort.
- Agent prompts are compartmentalized: each agent only receives its specific task description and interface info (no full project idea context).
- A compartment_check evaluator runs after each agent, automatically flagging any mention of the overall idea or other roles in outputs (to enforce scope isolation).
- The Synthesizer now detects cross-module contradictions or unresolved placeholders and includes them as “contradictions” in the final report, lowering confidence if any are found.
- Due to the Planner validation issue, the latest run produced no final report (pipeline stopped at planning). Minor idea references also still leaked into task descriptions (e.g. referring to “the microscope”), so full isolation isn’t yet achieved.
Next Steps (as tasks in codex_plan.yaml): - Update Planner output format (dr_rd/schemas, Planner prompt) to include all required plan metadata (e.g. plan summary, plan_id) so plans pass schema validation.
- Enforce neutral wording in Planner tasks (no final product names) via prompt tuning or post-generation checks to remove idea-specific terms.
- Adjust Planner generation settings (e.g. lower temperature or allow one automatic retry) to improve first-attempt JSON compliance and avoid run aborts.
- Remove the project idea from ReflectionAgent prompts (core/agents/reflection_agent.py) so iterative planning remains compartmentalized.
- Add tests (in tests/prompting/ and tests/eval/) to validate that task descriptions contain no leaked idea terms and that a complete plan JSON is produced on the first try.
Notes: With these refinements, the compartmentalization should reach near 10/10 alignment. The Planner and Synthesizer will fully enforce module isolation and integration consistency, eliminating the remaining context leakage and reliability issues.
