DR-RD Audit Change Log (tracking score changes and improvements)

2025-09-11 Update

Scores: Pipeline 9→10, Architecture 8→9, Prompt 9→10, Artifacts 9→10, Privacy 10→10.
Overall: The repository’s overall audit score improved notably, with multiple categories now at a perfect 10. Since the 2025-09-10 audit, the Pipeline and Prompt conformance gaps have been fully closed (final stage now schema-enforced), and Architecture saw a minor uplift by resolving role mapping inconsistencies. No regressions were introduced; all other areas (Artifacts, Privacy) remain at their previous high marks (one Artifact-related enhancement bumped that category to 10 as well).

Recent Merged PRs (Last 5):
• #476 – Feat: Schema-Enforced Final Synthesis. Reworked the final report generation to use the SynthesizerAgent with a JSON schema (synthesizer_v1.json). The Orchestrator now composes the final output via this agent, ensuring the result adheres to a strict schema (no free-form Markdown). This closes the final gap in end-to-end JSON compliance and improves consistency (every required section is present, and placeholder content is handled systematically).
• #475 – Chore: Legacy Mode Flags Cleanup. Removed deprecated “test”/“deep” mode toggles and related code paths. The application now operates under a single unified mode configuration at all times. Environment flags like DRRD_MODE are no longer used, and any legacy conditional logic has been excised, simplifying configuration and aligning with the Playbook addendum’s one-mode mandate.
• #474 – Refactor: Agent Role Audit & Synonyms. Audited the agent registry and routing logic to ensure all defined agents can be invoked. Added missing router keywords and synonyms (e.g., tasks containing “mechanical” now correctly route to the MechanicalSystemsLeadAgent). Introduced a startup validation that instantiates each agent in the registry to catch any integration issues. This effort cleaned up unused roles and solidified the agent mapping architecture (no more “orphan” agent classes lingering).
• #473 – Test: End-to-End Pipeline Smoke Test. Added a comprehensive integration test that runs a full DR-RD cycle with stubbed LLM responses. It verifies that the Planner, all agents, and the Synthesizer produce a final combined report with the expected sections (Summary, Findings, Risks, etc.), and that no “TODO/Not determined” placeholders appear in the output. This automated test provides confidence that the entire system works together as intended after recent changes (guarding against regression).
• #472 – Docs: Minor Updates to Playbook & Schema Notes. Updated internal documentation and schema comments to reflect recent changes (such as the unified final output format and removal of legacy modes). These doc tweaks ensure that developers and auditors have an accurate understanding of the system’s current design and compliance with the August 20, 2025 Playbook addendum.

Next Steps: Based on the latest audit, the next development priorities focus on final polish and ensuring no loose ends remain:

TSK-005: Surface or Remove Planner risk_register – If policy-aware planning is enabled, the Planner may output a risk_register (list of risks) in the plan. Currently, this isn’t propagated to any report. We should either integrate these risks into the final risk analysis or remove the field to avoid confusion. Targets: core/agents/planner_agent.py, dr_rd/schemas/planner_v1.json. Test: Run a policy-aware planning session and verify that any planner-generated risks are either visible in the QA agent’s findings/final report, or the risk_register field is stripped out before execution.

TSK-006: Consolidate Overlapping Agents – Address any duplicate or unused agent classes (e.g. consider merging the FinanceAgent and FinanceSpecialistAgent functionality). This will streamline the agent registry and ensure each defined agent serves a purpose in the pipeline. Targets: core/agents/finance_specialist_agent.py, core/agents/unified_registry.py. Test: Attempt to route a representative task for every agent role defined in AGENT_REGISTRY and confirm each yields a result. Remove or refactor roles that fail to route.

TSK-007: Update Final Prompt Template – Remove or update the old Synthesizer prompt template and related documentation now that final output is generated via schema. This prevents confusion between the legacy markdown sections and the current JSON-driven sections. Targets: dr_rd/prompting/prompt_registry.py (Synthesizer entry), docs/. Test: Static check that no outdated section names (e.g. “Regulatory & Compliance” heading) remain in the codebase; the end-to-end test should continue to pass with the schema-based output.

TSK-008: Utilize Task group Metadata – Incorporate the Planner’s task grouping feature into outputs or UI. Group identifiers assigned to tasks should be reflected, for instance by clustering related tasks in the work plan or final report for better readability. Targets: app/ UI display of plans, scripts/ reporting utilities. Test: Enable grouping in a sample plan (tasks with a group field) and verify the rendered output clearly denotes the groups (e.g., tasks under the same group are presented together with a heading or label).

2025-09-12 Update

Scores: Pipeline 10→10, Architecture 9→9, Prompt 10→10, Artifacts 10→10, Privacy 10→10.
Overall: The audit scores remain stable at 49/50, sustaining the significant improvements achieved in the previous update. Initially, the 2025-09-12 audit revealed a slight drop in the Artifacts category (due to minor output formatting bugs), but those issues were quickly fixed the same day. As a result, all categories are at or near perfection, with Pipeline, Prompt, Artifacts, and Privacy at 10, and only Architecture one point shy due to a few remaining enhancements in progress.

Recent Merged PRs:
• #477 – Fix: Final Report Output Polishing. Implemented a series of output formatting fixes for the user-facing report. The “Idea” in the Overview is now displayed cleanly (removing the internal tuple representation and listing constraints when present), the Trace summary table is fully populated (no more None or blank fields; each step shows proper phase and name including the final “Final Synthesis” step), and the Metrics section now correctly shows total tokens and cost used

. Additionally, all placeholder aliases (like the redacted project name) are properly rehydrated in the final report. These changes resolved the last output quality issues and brought the Artifact Completeness & Output Quality score back to 10/10.

Next Steps: With the output polish complete, the development focus returns to the outstanding items from the previous audit cycle (most of which are already underway):

TSK-005: Surface or Remove Planner risk_register – (Unchanged from 09-11) Ensure that any risks identified by the Planner either become part of the final report or are removed if unused, to avoid confusion. Targets: Planner agent & schema. Test: Verify policy-mode runs either include planner-produced risks in QA outputs or strip them out entirely.

TSK-006: Consolidate Overlapping Agents – (In progress) Some agent roles have been audited and updated (PR #474 added missing synonyms and removed truly unused agents), but further consolidation is planned. Notably, merging redundant roles (e.g. FinanceAgent vs FinanceSpecialistAgent) is still to be done to streamline the registry

. Targets: Finance-related agents, agent registry. Test: For every role in the registry, ensure there’s a corresponding planner task trigger and that redundant classes are eliminated or combined.

TSK-007: Update Final Prompt Template – (Pending) Now that the final output is generated via the Synthesizer’s JSON schema, any legacy prompt templates or documentation referring to the old final report format must be updated. Targets: Synthesizer prompt in prompt_registry, documentation. Test: Search for outdated section headings or instructions in code/docs and confirm they are removed; run the full test suite to confirm no references remain.

TSK-008: Utilize Task group Metadata – (Pending) Take advantage of task grouping metadata from the Planner to enhance report/UI structure. Related tasks should be presented together for clarity if grouping is used. Targets: Streamlit app UI, report builder scripts. Test: Simulate a run with grouped tasks and verify the final output visually groups those tasks (e.g. under common headings or sequentially with clear labels).
