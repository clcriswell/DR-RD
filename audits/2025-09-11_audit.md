DR-RD Repository Audit – 2025-09-11
1. Pipeline Conformance (Score: 9/10)
Unified Pipeline Implemented: The code follows the intended Planner → Router → Executor → Synthesizer sequence outlined in the Playbook. The Planner module produces a structured task list as a JSON object (enforced via a JSON schema contract). A Router/Registry then maps each planned task to the appropriate specialized agent class using a centralized AGENT_REGISTRY of roles, dispatching tasks accordingly. The Orchestrator executes each agent (in parallel by default) and then invokes a final synthesis step. This aligns with the addendum’s “standardized pipeline” design.
Strict JSON Contracts: At every stage, the system expects JSON-formatted outputs and includes mechanisms to handle any deviations. The Planner and agent prompts explicitly include JSON schema references and yield JSON strings; the Orchestrator parses and validates these responses, applying corrective measures if needed. For example, if an agent returns malformed or empty output, the Orchestrator will automatically retry or insert a placeholder JSON with default “Not determined” fields to ensure downstream stages receive a valid object. This reliability hardening (retry-on-failure with default safe output) follows Playbook guidance on enforcing JSON-only responses. In practice, we see that even when an agent fails to provide content after retries, the pipeline does not break – it logs an open issue and continues, guaranteeing a JSON result is always available for the next step.
Centralized Configuration: Runtime behavior is governed by unified config files and environment flags, as per the Playbook. All mode-specific branching has been removed in favor of a single “Standard” mode configuration. The code always loads the standard profile (any other profile name is rejected), and features like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) or live web search are toggled via environment variables (e.g. RAG_ENABLED, ENABLE_LIVE_SEARCH) rather than separate modes. Key parameters such as model selections, token budgets, and tool usage limits are defined in YAML config (e.g. config/budgets.yaml) and referenced in code, not hard-coded. This configuration-driven approach matches the addendum’s directive (“Config first”) and improves maintainability.
2.	Architectural Gaps (Score: 8/10)
Orchestrator & Registry Alignment: The implemented architecture largely matches the intended design. A unified agent registry and router are in place – the code defines a centralized mapping of role names to agent classes and uses it in the routing logic to instantiate/lookup the correct agent for each task. Business logic is correctly separated into orchestrator modules (with the Streamlit UI remaining a thin layer), exactly as the Playbook recommends. These components work together to cover planning, execution, and synthesis stages without major omissions.
Final Synthesizer Invocation: One minor divergence lies in the final synthesis stage. Currently, the Orchestrator calls the LLM to generate the combined final report and then parses it, rather than strictly using the SynthesizerAgent schema in generation. The code does attempt to parse the Synthesizer’s output as JSON and then format it to Markdown, but this final step isn’t fully constrained by a JSON schema at generation time (no automatic retry on format issues for the final output). The result is a coherent report, but it bypasses the strict JSON contract for that last stage. This is a minor architectural inconsistency – functionally the system achieves a merged output, but it could be made more robust by using the SynthesizerAgent’s JSON schema directly in the prompt (a point addressed in the improvement plan).
Agent Roster and Reachability: The agent roster implemented exceeds the initial 5–8 core roles, which is positive and in line with the guidance to expand into specialized roles. All major roles from the Playbook (Planner, CTO, Research Scientist, Materials Engineer, Regulatory, IP Analyst, QA, etc.) are present, and additional ones like Chief Scientist, Mechanical Systems Lead, and a Reflection reviewer agent are defined in the registry. However, there remain a few consistency gaps. For example, the MechanicalSystemsLeadAgent class exists in the code, but in the previous audit it was noted that it lacked routing keywords/synonyms to ever be invoked. A recent update partially addressed this by adding keywords for “mechanical” tasks in the router, but a full audit is still needed to ensure every defined agent can actually be triggered by the Planner’s output. In other words, some roles may still be “orphaned” (defined but not utilized) or duplicate each other. This is a minor integration gap that the team has identified – plans are in place to consolidate overlapping agents (e.g. Finance vs. Finance Specialist) and to update routing mappings for any missing links. Ensuring each registry entry is reachable (or else removing the dead code) will close this gap and streamline the multi-agent orchestration. Overall, no critical architecture component is missing, but tidying up these edge cases will polish the implementation.
3.	Prompt and Contract Conformance (Score: 9/10)
Standardized Prompt Templates: All agents use a consistent, structured prompt format defined in a central prompt specification. Each agent’s code constructs a spec with the same fields – including its role name, a structured task description, required JSON I/O schema reference, a retrieval policy level, and even evaluation hooks for self-checking output. For example, the FinanceAgent, CTOAgent, RegulatoryAgent, etc., all subclass the PromptFactoryAgent and define their prompts with an "io_schema_ref" (to a versioned JSON schema) and fields like "capabilities" and "evaluation_hooks" to enforce uniform behavior. This fulfills the Playbook’s mandate for consistent prompt contracts across roles. The PlannerAgent similarly produces a JSON plan according to a schema (tasks with id/title/summary) and includes hints like a risk register when policy flags are enabled.
JSON Output Formatting: The system explicitly instructs agents to output JSON and includes post-processing to ensure compliance. The code accounts for common LLM output quirks – for instance, it attempts to extract JSON from text even if extra markdown or content is present, and it sanitizes certain fields. We see utility functions that strip out markdown fences and repair JSON formatting issues, as well as routines to normalize and sanitize the sources field (converting any markdown links to plain URL entries, removing empty or malformed sources). Each agent’s JSON schema defines the expected types (e.g. lists for risks and next_steps), and the system will coerce or clean the agent’s returned JSON to match these types. In practice, the agent outputs observed are well-structured: fields like findings, risks, next_steps are present and properly formatted (no stray markdown or missing keys). Recent refinements in the prompt templates have further eliminated minor inconsistencies; for example, all agents now output risks and next_steps as arrays (even if empty), whereas previously some might have returned a single string for those fields.
Contract Enforcement and Self-Checks: The project treats prompts and outputs as “versioned code,” employing validation hooks to keep them in line. Many agents include custom evaluation hooks in their spec – for instance, the IPAnalystAgent uses a patent_overlap_check hook to verify its findings for patent search tasks. After an agent returns its result, the Orchestrator validates the JSON against Pydantic models (for structure and required fields) and will trigger a retry with a tightened prompt (e.g. explicitly asking for valid JSON only) if the output is not parseable or violates the schema. This is evident in tests and code: the generate_plan function, for example, will attempt to parse the planner’s raw output and, on failure, automatically retry once with a stricter instruction. The same pattern applies to agents – on a formatting error, the system logs the issue and re-invokes the agent or falls back to a safe placeholder as noted. Thanks to these measures, we did not encounter instances of agents deviating from their expected JSON structure in actual runs. (The slight one-point deduction here remains due to the final Synthesizer stage not yet being schema-constrained at generation time, as noted above. Plans are in place to address this, which would then yield a perfect 10 in prompt conformance.)
4.	Artifact Completeness (Score: 10/10)
Repository Structure: All key artifacts and modules expected from the Playbook are present in the repository. The codebase is organized into logical packages for core functionality and domain-specific extensions. There are dedicated directories for agents (core/agents/ and domain-specific dr_rd/ submodules), prompting (dr_rd/prompting/), retrieval and knowledge integration (dr_rd/rag/ for RAG logic), privacy (dr_rd/privacy/), simulation (dr_rd/simulation/), and more. The Streamlit front-end (app.py and app/ package) is in place to provide the UI, with minimal logic (most heavy lifting is in the orchestrators and agents, per design). Supporting documents like an Implementation Playbook (originals and addendum), user guide, and developer notes are included in the docs/ folder. The presence of these components matches the recommended layout (Planner/agents, tool definitions, UI, etc.) and shows a comprehensive implementation of the multi-agent R&D system.
Configuration & Modes: The consolidation to one runtime mode (“Standard”) is fully reflected in the code artifacts. Legacy mode toggles (e.g. separate “test” vs “deep” modes) have been removed or deprecated. For example, the config loader explicitly only accepts the "standard" profile, and environment variables like DRRD_MODE are no longer used to branch logic. The config files (config/modes.yaml, config/budgets.yaml, etc.) define different budget profiles (standard, low_cost, high_cost) but these are profiles for resource limits, not different behavior modes. The application always runs in a single code path, with optional features (web search, advanced evaluators) toggled via flags. This unification is in line with the addendum’s guidance, and the code (and documentation) has been updated so that no outdated “mode” remains in active use.
Schemas and Tools: Every agent role has a corresponding JSON schema in the repository defining its output format (e.g. planner_v1.json, cto_v2.json, regulatory_v2.json, finance_v2.json, etc.), and these schemas are directly referenced in the agent specs. The use of versioned schema files indicates an iterative refinement of output structures over time (for instance, moving from v1 to v2 as improvements were made). All required schemas are accounted for; we did not find any agent producing output without a defined schema contract. Similarly, the system’s tool integrations are defined declaratively. For example, the available tools (such as search functions or calculation utilities) are configured in config/tools.yaml and loaded at runtime via a tool router mechanism in code. The code checks tool allowlists and usage quotas via a central tool_router and billing/quotas module, ensuring any external API/tool usage is controlled and logged. These artifacts fulfill the Playbook’s expectation of extensible tool interfaces and demonstrate foresight in design (tools can be added or modified via config).
Testing and CI: A robust test suite accompanies the implementation, covering core functionality and many edge cases. Unit tests exist for the planning stage (ensuring the Planner’s JSON output is parsed correctly and yields task objects), for the execution stage (e.g. routing tasks and verifying agent outputs merge correctly), and for the synthesizer/final assembly. There are tests specifically targeting JSON formatting and placeholder handling – for instance, verifying that if an agent returns placeholder text for findings/risks, the system identifies it and labels it as an open issue in the final report. An example is a test that sets an agent’s output to all “Not determined” and checks that the final compiled report contains a “Gaps and Unresolved Issues” section to flag that content. Privacy features are also indirectly tested (ensuring that the redaction mechanism can handle inputs – see below). The continuous integration (CI) pipeline (GitHub Actions) runs these tests on every push, along with linting and type checks, and even performs security scans. For instance, a gitleaks job runs to scan the repository for any secrets, and the project maintains a .env.example file with dummy keys to encourage proper secret management. This level of test coverage and CI enforcement means the project is not only feature-complete but also reliable: issues like JSON format errors or integration bugs are likely to be caught during development. (Going forward, a suggested improvement is to add a full end-to-end smoke test that runs the entire pipeline on a sample idea with stubbed LLM calls – this would further ensure integration integrity, though given the modular tests in place, the coverage is already strong. Overall, all necessary artifacts – code, config, documentation, and tests – are present and of high quality, meriting a top score in this category.)
5.	Redaction and Privacy (Score: 10/10)
Input Redaction & Pseudonymization: The system takes privacy and data handling seriously, following the Playbook’s guidance to “obfuscate each subtask” and only share need-to-know information with each agent. Before any user idea or task description is passed to an agent (or to an external tool/API), it is run through a Redactor that replaces sensitive entities with placeholders. In the Orchestrator’s _invoke_agent function, for example, every field of a task except the role/title is redacted – personal names, company names, or any proper nouns in the task description would be swapped out for neutral aliases (e.g. “PersonX”, “CompanyY”). The same happens for the overall idea context: when preparing the Planner input, the code redacts the main idea and any user-provided constraints up front. An alias map is stored so that these placeholders can be later reversed. This means that each specialist agent receives only anonymized, minimal context – for instance, a Materials Engineer agent might see “Design a component for ProjectX device” instead of the real product name, if that name were sensitive. This design mitigates the risk of an agent or external API call leaking private details, since agents operate on sanitized inputs.
Need-to-Know Context Sharing: By design, each agent is given only the information relevant to its task, not the entire project scope. The Planner gets the high-level (redacted) idea and high-level requirements to break down, but it doesn’t receive details that are outside scope. Then, when the Executor routes tasks, each agent’s prompt includes only that agent’s specific task description (and the top-level idea in a summarized form) as input – not the other agents’ tasks or outputs. This is evident in the agent prompt specs, which show the agent’s inputs contain the idea and its own task only. The one role that sees a broader view is the Reflection/QA agent at the end (if present), which may review all findings for consistency – and even in that case, the combined content is pseudonymized. This segmented context approach aligns perfectly with privacy best practices: no agent is given more data than necessary to perform its function, reducing potential exposure of information.
Secret Management: No API keys or credentials are hard-coded in the repository. All integration keys (OpenAI API, SerpAPI for search, etc.) are expected to be provided via environment variables or Streamlit secrets configuration. The repository includes an .env.example file with placeholders, and the code uses utility functions to fetch keys from the environment (for example, SERPAPI_KEY is loaded via an env getter and defaults to blank if not set). We also see that the project runs automated secret scans in CI to prevent accidental commits of secrets. The Playbook’s rule of keeping secrets out of code is clearly being followed – our review found no instances of actual secret values in the codebase. All sensitive tokens are injected at runtime, and the repository is configured to catch any such mistake should it occur.
Output Rehydration: After all processing is done, the system “rehydrates” the final outputs with the original names and terms for the user’s benefit. The orchestrator accumulates the alias mappings from the redaction step and, once the final Synthesizer output is ready, it replaces the placeholders with the real names in the final report. We confirmed this in code: after generating the final JSON, the rehydrate_output function is applied to swap back any aliased terms. This ensures that while the internal processing used anonymized data (protecting privacy), the end result presented to the user is meaningful and specific to their original query (e.g. “Alice Corp” will appear in the final text if the user provided that name, even though agents only ever saw it as “CompanyX”). The rehydration process strikes an excellent balance between privacy and usefulness.
In summary, the project demonstrates excellent compliance with privacy and redaction requirements. All personal or sensitive data is handled via a configurable redaction policy (currently a “light” mode that likely targets proper nouns), no unnecessary data is shared between agents, and secrets are properly managed. We did not identify any privacy leaks or unsafe data handling in the code. The strong redaction mechanism and careful context management earn a full score in this category.
Sources: The findings above are based on an in-depth review of the DR-RD codebase (repository clcriswell/DR-RD on GitHub) and the project’s “DRRD Playbook – Consolidated Edition (Aug 20, 2025)” which defines the expected goals. Specific file references from the repository are included inline. Overall, the implementation closely aligns with the Playbook’s architecture and standards, with only a few minor discrepancies noted, all of which are being addressed in ongoing development. The audit reflects that as of September 11, 2025, the system is very robust and nearly fully compliant with the envisioned design, with planned improvements (outlined in the attached plan) set to resolve the remaining gaps.
