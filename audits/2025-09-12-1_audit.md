DR-RD Audit for September 12, 2025

DR-RD Repository Audit – 2025-09-12-1

Pipeline Conformance (Score: 10/10)
Unified Pipeline Execution: The implementation fully adheres to the Playbook’s standardized pipeline of Planner → Router → Executor → Synthesizer. The Planner produces a structured list of tasks in JSON (validated against a schema and normalized) which is stored for execution
GitHub
. A Router/Registry maps each task’s intended role to the corresponding agent class (via a centralized AGENT_REGISTRY) and the Orchestrator invokes each agent sequentially (with parallelism options for efficiency) before running a final synthesis step
GitHub
. This matches the Addendum’s “unified architecture” design and ensures each stage is clearly delineated.

Strict JSON Contracts: JSON-only outputs are enforced at every stage, reflecting the Playbook’s reliability guidelines
GitHub
. The Planner and all agents include an io_schema_ref for their JSON schema, and the Orchestrator parses and validates each response against these schemas
GitHub
. If an agent’s output is malformed or contains placeholder text, the system automatically triggers a correction: for example, the Planner will retry once with an explicit “return valid JSON” instruction upon detecting malformed output
GitHub
. Similarly, the agent execution loop uses a validate_and_retry mechanism (backed by functions like attempt_auto_fix) to enforce well-formed JSON
GitHub
. These measures ensure a valid JSON object is always produced for downstream steps. In the latest run, no pipeline breaks occurred – each task yielded a properly structured JSON result on the first attempt or after an automated retry, demonstrating robust error-handling.

 

End-to-End Integration: Recent updates closed the last gap in JSON enforcement. Notably, the final synthesis stage now uses the SynthesizerAgent with a strict JSON schema (synthesizer_v1.json), rather than a free-form prompt. The Orchestrator aggregates agent outputs and invokes the Synthesizer to produce a JSON-formatted final report
GitHub
. This change means the entire pipeline (planning through final report) remains within defined JSON contracts, eliminating the inconsistency noted in earlier audits. An end-to-end integration test was added to ensure the Planner, all agents, and the Synthesizer work together to produce a consolidated report with all expected sections and no placeholder content
GitHub
. With these improvements, the pipeline execution flow is fully aligned with the Playbook’s vision and scores a perfect 10.

Architectural Alignment and Gaps (Score: 9/10)
Sound Modular Architecture: The system’s overall architecture closely matches the intended design. Core logic is cleanly separated: a unified agent registry (core/agents/unified_registry.py) defines all agent classes and their canonical role keys, and the router logic uses this to dispatch tasks to the correct agent
GitHub
. The Streamlit UI layer is thin, delegating business logic to orchestrator and executor modules, which is in line with Playbook best practices. The agent roster has expanded beyond the initial 5–8 roles, including specialized agents like MechanicalSystemsLead, ChiefScientist, Reflection, etc., demonstrating the recommended extensibility
GitHub
. All primary roles from the Playbook (Planner, CTO, Research Scientist, Materials Engineer, Regulatory, IP Analyst, QA, Finance, etc.) are implemented and, after recent fixes, most are readily reachable via the planning→routing process. For example, tasks containing “mechanical” keywords now correctly route to the MechanicalSystemsLeadAgent (addressing a previous gap)
GitHub
. A startup validation now instantiates every agent in the registry to catch integration issues early, ensuring no agent class is misconfigured
GitHub
. These refinements have solidified the agent-mapping architecture and resolved prior “orphaned” agents that were defined but never invoked.

Minor Remaining Gaps: The one-point deduction in this category reflects a few minor enhancements still in progress. First, there is a slight overlap in agent roles: the codebase has both a FinanceAgent and a FinanceSpecialistAgent with similar purposes. Currently, only “Finance” is used in the registry
GitHub
, meaning the FinanceSpecialistAgent is effectively unused. Consolidating these (merging or removing the redundant class) will streamline the registry and avoid confusion. Plans to merge overlapping roles (e.g. treating “Finance Specialist” tasks as FinanceAgent) are noted in the task backlog
GitHub
. Second, the Planner supports grouping tasks by themes (via an optional group field in its output schema), but this metadata is not yet utilized in the UI or report. In the latest run, all tasks were handled sequentially without grouping, and any group labels were essentially ignored. Enhancing the output presentation to cluster or label tasks by their group (when provided) is a pending improvement
GitHub
. Aside from these cleanup items, the architecture is robust: no major component is missing or mis-designed. The system successfully orchestrates planning, multi-agent execution, and synthesis. Once the minor role consolidation and task grouping features are completed, the architecture should reach a 10/10 alignment with the Playbook.

Prompt and Contract Conformance (Score: 10/10)
Standardized Prompt Templates: Every agent follows a consistent prompt structure defined via the PromptFactory/PromptRegistry system
GitHub
. Each agent’s prompt specification includes its role name, a task description context, an io_schema_ref pointing to the JSON schema for its output, and (where appropriate) retrieval policies and self-check hooks. This uniform approach meets the Playbook’s mandate for consistent prompt contracts. For example, the CTOAgent, RegulatoryAgent, MarketingAgent, etc., all subclass PromptFactoryAgent and define required fields like summary, findings, risks, next_steps, and sources in their schemas
GitHub
GitHub
. The PlannerAgent similarly outputs a structured list of tasks with defined fields (id, title, description, role, etc.), and the system normalizes any missing fields to ensure downstream agents always receive the expected structure
GitHub
GitHub
. We observed in the latest run that every agent’s output JSON adhered to its schema – each contained the proper keys with appropriately typed values, and no agent deviated from its contract.

JSON-Only Responses: The prompting framework explicitly instructs agents to return only JSON and forbids Markdown or extraneous text in their answers
GitHub
GitHub
. The code reinforces this by extracting JSON from model responses and discarding any non-JSON prefix or suffix if it appears
GitHub
. Common LLM quirks like including markdown code fences or extra commentary are automatically handled. The system also sanitizes outputs: for instance, if an agent mistakenly returns a list where a string is expected, a type coercion fixes it, and any keys not defined in the schema are stripped out
GitHub
. In practice, these safeguards were effective – none of the agent outputs in the 2025-09-12 run contained markdown formatting or invalid types. Even single-item lists were correctly output as JSON arrays (thanks to schema v2 updates), and placeholder values like "Not determined" were inserted only where data was truly unavailable. The final Synthesizer stage is now equally strict: by generating the final report via a JSON schema (with fields like summary, key_points, risks, etc.), the last stage no longer introduces any free-form formatting
GitHub
. This closes the only previously noted prompt conformance gap. All prompts can now be considered “versioned code” – changes to prompt templates and schemas are tracked, and tests (including a full pipeline smoke test) ensure that any prompt changes do not break the expected JSON structure
GitHub
. Given these practices, prompt contracts and outputs are fully in line with Playbook expectations.

Artifact Completeness and Output Quality (Score: 10/10)
Comprehensive Repository Artifacts: The project’s repository includes all expected artifacts and follows the structured layout prescribed by the Playbook. The directory structure covers agents/, core/ orchestration logic, dr_rd/ domain-specific modules (schemas, prompting, knowledge base, etc.), as well as config/ files for settings and tools, and tests/ for the test suite
GitHub
GitHub
. Key JSON schemas for each agent role are present under dr_rd/schemas/ (e.g. planner_v1.json, cto_v2.json, marketing_v2.json, etc.), and these are kept up-to-date as agent outputs evolve
GitHub
. All integration points (like external tool configurations in config/tools.yaml, retrieval settings, etc.) are represented in the repo, which indicates nothing is missing in terms of code or configuration artifacts. The testing framework is also robust: a wide range of unit tests and integration tests exist, covering everything from JSON validation and redaction to full end-to-end execution with stubbed model responses
GitHub
GitHub
. Continuous integration is configured to run the test suite and even perform secret scanning, aligning with best practices. In summary, the codebase contains the complete set of components and supporting files expected for a project of this nature, fulfilling the Playbook’s requirements for artifact completeness.

Output Quality and Formatting: All expected output artifacts are being generated by the pipeline. In the latest run (post-PR #485), the system produced: a plan JSON (plan.json) with 7 tasks from the Planner, structured agent result objects for each task (logged in the trace), and a final synthesized report (report.md). Every planned task led to a corresponding agent output, which was then included in the final report – no task was dropped or left unresolved. Moreover, several minor formatting issues identified in the earlier 09-12 audit have since been fixed. Notably, the Overview/Idea section of the final report now cleanly displays the project idea (and any constraints) without exposing internal tuple representations
GitHub
. The Trace summary table in the Streamlit UI is now fully populated: each step shows the correct phase and task name, and the final “Final Synthesis” step is labeled properly, with no blank or “None” fields remaining
GitHub
. The Metrics section correctly reports the total token usage and cost for the run, resolving the prior issue where it showed 0 values
GitHub
. In addition, the Planner’s risk_register output (when policy-aware planning is enabled) is now surfaced in the final artifacts. If the Planner identifies any upfront risks, those are aggregated into the final report’s Risks section (under overall project risks) so that nothing is lost; for example, in a test scenario a planner-generated risk class “policy” appeared as a bullet under Risks in the report
GitHub
. All placeholder alias tokens (e.g., the internal project codename used during agent calls) are correctly rehydrated in the user-facing outputs, so the final report contains the real project idea and names, not placeholders. With these fixes, the final outputs are not only complete but polished. The audit team did not find any missing content or new formatting anomalies in the latest run’s deliverables. Given that all output pieces (tasks, findings, summaries, sources, etc.) are present and neatly presented, this category has been raised back to 10/10.

Redaction and Privacy Handling (Score: 10/10)
Input Redaction & Context Isolation: The system maintains a strong commitment to privacy and follows the Playbook’s guidelines to obfuscate sensitive information at every step. Before any user input or intermediate data is sent to an LLM or external tool, it passes through a redaction layer. In the code, the Orchestrator’s _invoke_agent function uses a Redactor to scrub or pseudonymize content: each task field (except non-sensitive ones like the role/title) is redacted, and an alias_map of placeholders is attached to the task payload
GitHub
. Similarly, the user’s main idea and any constraints are run through the Redactor at the planning stage
GitHub
. This ensures that proper nouns, unique names, or any potentially identifying details are replaced with generic tokens (like “ProjectDevice” or other aliases) before the data reaches the model. In the 2025-09-12 post-PR485 run, we confirmed via logs that the project idea “quantum entanglement microscope” was internally transformed into a placeholder name (e.g. QuantumEntanglementMicroscopeDevice) for all agent prompts – none of the agents saw the actual phrase, only the pseudonym. Each agent therefore worked on a need-to-know basis with sanitized context relevant only to its task.

No Leaks in Outputs or Logs: All intermediate outputs remain in the redacted form, and crucially, the system rehydrates the placeholders back to the original terms only in the final user-facing output. The final report presented to the user had the real project name (“quantum entanglement microscope”) in all the right places, achieved by a rehydration step that runs on the combined report text
GitHub
. Because of this design, even if internal logs or agent outputs were inspected, they contain no sensitive information – only the temporary aliases. The alias map used for rehydration is kept internal and is not exposed in any user output. Our audit of the logs and artifacts found no instances of unmasked sensitive data; every occurrence of the project name or specific term was either in its aliased form internally or properly reverted in the final output. The repository also adheres to secrets management best practices: no API keys or credentials are present in the code (developers use environment variables/Streamlit secrets for keys, as documented), and automated secret scanning is part of the CI tests
GitHub
. Even debug logs are careful not to print sensitive values (they typically log placeholders and generic messages). In sum, the privacy-by-design approach is clearly effective. The DR-RD system fully meets the Playbook’s privacy and redaction standards – sensitive inputs are protected throughout processing and gracefully restored only when presenting results to the user. We assign a 10/10 here, as we found no privacy gaps or regressions in the latest audit.

 

Sources: This report is based on the DR-RD codebase (clcriswell/DR-RD repository) at the time of the 2025-09-12 audit, the “DRRD Playbook — Consolidated Edition Addendum” (Aug 20, 2025), and the execution logs/artifacts from a post-PR #485 system run. All code and configuration references are cited inline above. The implementation shows strong alignment with the Playbook’s goals across all categories. Remaining action items (like agent consolidation and task grouping) are noted, and corresponding tasks have been defined in the planning document. With those addressed, DR-RD will fully achieve the envisioned design and reliability standards.
