# Plan v2 Audit

## Summary
No proof-of-concept test plan artifacts were found. The repository lacks a PoC test plan template, simulation hooks for fast feedback, and an environment matrix for test runs.

## Checklist
- [FAIL] 3.1 PoC test plan template exists with hypotheses, scenarios, metrics, pass/fail gates
- [FAIL] 3.2 Hooks for simulation or fast feedback loops exist
- [FAIL] 3.3 Environment matrix defined for test runs

## Evidence
- No `docs/poc_test_plan.md`
- No `simulation/hooks.py`
- No `config/environment_matrix.yaml`

## Gaps
- Missing PoC test plan template documenting hypotheses, scenarios, metrics, and gates
- No simulation hooks to enable fast feedback loops
- No environment matrix covering supported test configurations

## Minimal fix suggestions
- Add `docs/poc_test_plan.md` template outlining hypotheses, scenarios, metrics, and pass/fail gates
- Introduce `simulation/hooks.py` or equivalent to simulate components and capture feedback
- Define `config/environment_matrix.yaml` detailing environments for test runs
