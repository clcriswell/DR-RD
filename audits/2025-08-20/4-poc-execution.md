# PoC Execution Audit

## Summary
The simulation manager provides basic stubs, but there is no routing of failing results or persistence of simulation artifacts.

## Checklist
- [PASS] 4.1 Simulation harness or digital twin entrypoint exists with seed data
- [FAIL] 4.2 Results routed to QA or back to research on FAIL
- [FAIL] 4.3 Artifacts persisted under a runs/ or outputs/ folder with timestamps

## Evidence
- `simulation/simulation_manager.py` implements `SimulationManager` with seeded metrics
- No module or function found to route failing simulation results to QA or research
- No `runs/` or `outputs/` directories present in repository root

## Gaps
- Missing logic to forward failing simulations to QA workflows or additional research
- Simulation outputs are not stored under timestamped directories for traceability

## Minimal fix suggestions
- Introduce a routing mechanism (e.g., `orchestrators/qa_router.py`) to handle simulation failures
- Persist simulation outputs under a `runs/` or `outputs/` directory with timestamped subfolders
