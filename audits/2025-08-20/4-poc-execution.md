# PoC Execution Audit

## Summary
Simulation harness exists, but QA routing and run artifact persistence are absent.

## Checklist
- [PASS] 4.1 Simulation harness or digital twin entrypoint exists with seed data
- [FAIL] 4.2 Results routed to QA or back to research on FAIL
- [FAIL] 4.3 Artifacts persisted under a runs/ or outputs/ folder with timestamps

## Evidence
- `simulation/simulation_manager.py` provides a harness
- `core/agents/qa_agent.py` not found
- `runs/` or `outputs/` directories missing
- Failing tests:
  - `tests/audit/test_poc_execution.py::test_results_routed_to_qa_or_research`
  - `tests/audit/test_poc_execution.py::test_run_artifacts_persisted`

## Gaps
- No QA routing for failed simulations
- Missing persistence of run artifacts

## Minimal Fix Suggestions
- Add QA agent or routing to handle failed results
- Persist simulation outputs under timestamped `runs/` or `outputs/` folders
