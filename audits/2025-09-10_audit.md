DR-RD Repository Audit – 2025-09-10
1. Pipeline Conformance (Score: 9/10)

Unified Pipeline Implemented: The code follows the Planner → Router → Executor → Synthesizer pipeline as outlined in the Playbook. The Planner generates a structured task plan (JSON)
GitHub
, a Router/Registry maps each task to a specialized agent class
GitHub
, and an Orchestrator executes each agent sequentially (or in parallel if enabled) before calling a final synthesis step. This aligns with the “standardized pipeline” described in the addendum.

Strict JSON Contracts: The system enforces JSON-only outputs at each stage. Planner and agent prompts include a predefined JSON schema reference, and the Orchestrator validates/parses responses accordingly
GitHub
. If an agent’s output is malformed, it triggers automatic corrections and retries
GitHub
, ensuring a valid JSON object is always produced for downstream steps. This reliability hardening matches Playbook guidance (strict JSON responses and retry on error).

Centralized Configuration: Runtime behavior is governed by centralized config files (e.g. config/modes.yaml, config/prices.yaml). The code loads a single “standard” profile from these files
GitHub
, and uses environment flags (e.g. RAG_ENABLED, ENABLE_LIVE_SEARCH) to toggle features per the Playbook. Key parameters (model choices, budgets, tool limits) are defined in config, not hard-coded, as expected. This configuration-driven design earns high marks for maintainability.

2. Architectural Gaps (Score: 8/10)

Orchestrator & Registry Alignment: The implementation largely matches the intended architecture. A centralized agent registry and a simple router are in place – the code defines a unified AGENT_REGISTRY of roles to classes
GitHub
 and uses it to dispatch tasks to the correct agent
GitHub
. Business logic is contained in orchestrator modules (e.g. core.orchestrator.py), keeping the Streamlit UI thin, which is consistent with Playbook expectations.

Synthesizer Usage Deviation: One divergence is in the final synthesis stage. Instead of using the SynthesizerAgent to produce a JSON result (per the schema) and then formatting it for display, the orchestrator directly constructs a prompt from all agent outputs and calls the LLM to generate the final markdown report
GitHub
. This means the final output is not constrained by a JSON schema at generation time. While the end result is a coherent report, it bypasses the strict JSON contract for the Synthesizer agent defined in the Playbook. This could be seen as a minor architectural gap in consistency, though functionally the system still achieves a merged output.

Agent Roster and Roles: The implemented agent roster exceeds the initial Playbook baseline of 5–8 roles, which is positive and in line with the guidance to expand to specialized roles. All major roles (Planner, CTO, Research Scientist, Materials, Regulatory, IP, QA, etc.) are present, and additional ones like “Chief Scientist,” “Mechanical Systems Lead,” and “Reflection” agents have been introduced
GitHub
. However, there are a few inconsistencies: for example, the MechanicalSystemsLeadAgent exists in the code
GitHub
 but no routing keywords or synonyms map to it, so it may never be invoked in practice. This suggests a minor integration gap where certain agent classes are defined but not utilized. Overall, no critical architecture component is missing, but ensuring every agent in the registry is reachable (or pruning unused ones) would close this gap.

3. Prompt and Contract Conformance (Score: 9/10)

Standardized Prompt Templates: All agents use a consistent prompt structure defined in a central registry (prompt_registry). Each agent’s prompt spec includes its role name, a structured “task” description, required JSON I/O schema, and a retrieval policy setting
GitHub
. This uniform contract across agents fulfills the Playbook’s mandate for consistent prompt contracts and roles-specific capabilities. For example, the CTOAgent, MaterialsEngineerAgent, RegulatoryAgent, etc., all subclass a PromptFactory and define their spec with the same fields (role, inputs, io_schema_ref, etc.), ensuring contract consistency.

JSON Output Formatting: The prompting logic explicitly instructs agents to output JSON compliant with their schema. The documentation confirms that common pitfalls (e.g. trailing commas, markdown in JSON) are auto-corrected and that each agent defines how sources should be formatted
GitHub
. We see this in practice: agents like the IPAnalystAgent enforce a list of source URLs/IDs in their schema
GitHub
, and the system sanitizes outputs (e.g. dropping empty entries) to meet these rules. As a result, agent outputs observed are well-structured (fields like findings, risks, next_steps, etc.) with no extraneous formatting.

Contract Enforcement and Self-checks: The code uses evaluation_hooks (self-check functions) in agent specs to verify outputs. For instance, the IPAnalystAgent includes a patent_overlap_check hook in its spec
GitHub
. Moreover, after an agent returns, the orchestrator validates the JSON against Pydantic models or schemas and triggers a retry with a “return valid JSON only” prompt if needed
GitHub
. These measures closely follow the Playbook’s emphasis on treating prompts as “versioned code” and ensuring reliability in agent responses. The prompt and output handling is therefore very much in conformance; we did not encounter cases of agents deviating from their expected JSON structure. (The slight deduction in score here is tied to the Synthesizer stage using a free-form prompt, as noted above.)

4. Artifact Completeness (Score: 9/10)

Repository Structure: All key artifacts and directories expected from the Playbook are present. The repository contains dedicated modules for core logic, agents, prompting, RAG (retrieval), knowledge base, reporting, integrations, simulation, safety, ops/utilities, schemas, and tool definitions
GitHub
. This corresponds exactly to the layout recommended (e.g. agents/, core/, prompting/, etc. are all in place). The app.py Streamlit front-end and scripts/ for running cycles/reports are also present, completing the expected scaffold.

Configuration & Modes: The consolidation to one runtime mode (“standard”) is reflected in the artifacts. Legacy mode toggles have been removed in favor of config files (modes.yaml, budgets.yaml, etc.) which define different budget profiles (standard, low, high)
GitHub
GitHub
. For example, app/config_loader.py always loads the standard profile
GitHub
. This means the repository is up-to-date with the unified mode design (no split between “test” vs “deep” modes), consistent with the addendum’s guidance
GitHub
. The feature_flags.py still contains some legacy flags for backward compatibility, but the primary configuration source is the new YAML profiles.

Schemas and Tool Definitions: Every agent has a corresponding JSON schema in dr_rd/schemas/ defining its output format (e.g. planner_v1.json, cto_v2.json, regulatory_v2.json, etc.), and these are referenced in the code
GitHub
. The presence of versioned schemas (v1, v2) indicates iteration and refinement of the output structure over time. No expected schema is missing for the roles implemented. Similarly, the system’s tools are defined in config (config/tools.yaml) and registered at startup
GitHub
. Tools like simulate, read_repo, and domain-specific search utilities are integrated via the core.tool_router mechanism, and the code checks tool allowlists and usage limits – fulfilling the artifact requirement for extensible tool definitions.

Testing Scaffold: A comprehensive test suite exists (tests/ directory) to cover core functionality. Unit tests cover the orchestrator logic, output artifact generation, routing fallbacks, agent JSON validation
GitHub
, privacy redaction
GitHub
, and more. The provided CI configuration (GitHub Actions) runs these tests along with linting and even secret scanning, as indicated in project docs
GitHub
. This level of test coverage and CI enforcement demonstrates completeness in the development artifacts (the Playbook’s mention of “low-cost smoke tests” and a dry-run mode is implemented via a dry_run config and some test fixtures as well). Only very minor areas for improvement exist – for example, an end-to-end integration test scenario could be added – but overall the necessary scaffolding is present and actively used.

5. Redaction and Privacy (Score: 10/10)

Input Redaction & Pseudonymization: The system takes privacy seriously and adheres to the Playbook’s guidance to “obfuscate each subtask” and provide only need-to-know context. Before an idea or any task context is passed to an agent, it is run through a Redactor that replaces proper names and sensitive entities with aliases. In core.orchestrator._invoke_agent, for example, each task field (except role/title) is redacted and an alias_map is attached
GitHub
GitHub
. This ensures that agents (and external API calls they might invoke) receive anonymized context (e.g. “Alice Smith at Bob Corp” becomes “PersonX at CompanyY”), mitigating privacy risks.

Need-to-Know Context Sharing: Each specialist agent is given only the information relevant to its task, not the entire project context. The Planner receives the high-level idea (redacted) and constraints to create tasks. Then each agent gets its task description (again redacted) and the global idea in a minimal form. The only agent that sees a consolidated view is the QA/Reflection stage, which is by design for a final consistency check. Even in that case, the combined context is pseudonymized. This segmented approach aligns perfectly with the privacy principles in the Playbook (no agent sees more than necessary).

Secret Management: No API keys or secrets are hard-coded in the repository. All keys (OpenAI API, SerpAPI, etc.) are expected via environment variables or Streamlit secrets. The presence of an .env.example file
GitHub
 and the use of get_env in config loading confirm this practice. Additionally, the project includes automated secret scanning (e.g. running gitleaks as part of tests/CI) to prevent any secret leakage
GitHub
. This adheres to the Playbook’s rule that keys should reside in secure config, not in code. We found no instances of hard-coded credentials or personal data in the codebase.

Proper Data Rehydration: After processing is done, the system rehydrates the final outputs with the original names/terms for the user. The orchestrator stores an alias mapping and later uses it to replace placeholders in the synthesized report
GitHub
. This means the user sees a final plan that refers to “Alice” and “Bob Corp” (for example) in the right places, but during processing these were abstracted away. This technique ensures privacy without sacrificing result fidelity. Overall, the project demonstrates excellent compliance with privacy and redaction requirements, and we did not identify any privacy leaks or unsafe data handling.

Sources: The findings above are based on the DR-RD codebase (clcriswell/DR-RD repo) and the “DRRD Playbook — Consolidated Edition Addendum” dated Aug 20, 2025. Specific file references from the repository are included inline. The audit confirms that the implementation is largely in line with the Playbook’s architecture and guidelines, with only a few minor discrepancies or areas for improvement as noted.
