# Codex Contribution Rules

- Before editing files, parse and understand `repo_map.yaml`.
- After making changes, run `make repo-map` to regenerate `repo_map.yaml` and `docs/REPO_MAP.md`.
- Commit the regenerated map and docs in the same pull request as the changes.
- Run `make repo-validate` before submitting to ensure the map and configuration are consistent.
