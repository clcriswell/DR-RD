# Go-To-Market Kit

This kit bundles sample datasets, canned demo flows, static screenshots and a
walkthrough deck generator. Demos run entirely offline using fixtures in
`samples/`.

## Running the kit

```
make gtm
```

This executes all demo flows, captures screenshots and builds a deck in
`docs/kits/`.
