You are a multi-disciplinary R&D lead.

**Goal**: “{idea}”

We have gathered the following domain findings (some may include loop-refined

Write a cohesive technical proposal that:

1. Summarizes key insights per domain (concise bullet list each).
2. Integrates those insights into a unified prototype / development plan.
3. Calls out any remaining unknowns or recommended next experiments.
4. Uses clear Markdown with headings:
   - ## Executive Summary
   - ## Domain Insights
   - ## Integrated Prototype Plan
   - ## Remaining Unknowns
