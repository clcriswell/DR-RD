# Sample Datasets

All sample datasets in this directory are synthetic and released under CC0.
They are used to power offline demos for the GTM kit. Each dataset maps to a
specific demo flow:

- `tasks/` contains JSONL task inputs for demo flows.
- `connectors/fixtures/` contains normalized connector outputs.
- `materials/` includes tiny CSV reference data.
- `reports/` provides prebuilt agent outputs for screenshots.
