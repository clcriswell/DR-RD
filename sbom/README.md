# SBOM

This directory contains Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) outputs for the project.

## Artifacts
- `cyclonedx-python.json` &mdash; SBOM for the current Python environment generated by [`cyclonedx-bom`](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-python).
- `cyclonedx-repo.json` &mdash; SBOM for the repository filesystem generated by [`syft`](https://github.com/anchore/syft) when available.

## Regeneration
Regenerate the SBOMs locally with:

```bash
python scripts/gen_sbom.py
# or
make sbom
```

Outputs are overwritten on each run.

## Verification
Inspect or validate the generated SBOMs with CycloneDX tools or other compatible scanners. CI publishes these files as build artifacts and attaches them to tagged releases.
